# Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting

### Overview
Predict the Future with MLPs, CNNs and LSTMs in Python

### Description
Welcome to Deep Learning for Time Series Forecasting. Deep learning methods, such as
Multilayer Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long Short-Term Memory Networks,
can be used to automatically learn the temporal dependence structures for challenging time
series forecasting problems. Neural networks may not be the best solution for all time series
forecasting problems, but for those problems where classical methods fail and machine learning
methods require elaborate feature engineering, deep learning methods can be used with great
success. This book was designed to teach you, step-by-step, how to develop deep learning
methods for time series forecasting with concrete and executable examples in Python.
